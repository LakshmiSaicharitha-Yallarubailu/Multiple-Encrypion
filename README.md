# Multiple-Encrypion
The main idea is to achieve multiple encryption using the above mentioned algorithms. It is the process of encrypting an already encrypted message one or more times, either using the same or different algorithm.
For the multiple encryption, we used the Caesar Cipher, AES Cipher, XOR Cipher, Blowfish Cipher algorithms.
For the super encryption (the outer encryption), we used the RC6 file encryption algorithm
